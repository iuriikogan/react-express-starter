# react-express-travel-tracker

a starter project with express backend and react frontend

This is a project I used to learn GeoSpatial APIs,
I also implemented a functional authentication
and user role authorization policy on the backend 
in node.js with Auth0 and passport.js



# Create ENV file from env.sample

# Install front end dependencies
npm i --save

# Install Backend Dependencies
cd backend
npm i --save

# run frontend /backend
from root directory: npm run start / cd backend / npm run start

I like feedback....
